### Hi there - it's Tucker!
I'm a freshman @ Duke planning to study Electrical and Computer Enginnering. I'm open to summer internships at the moment, so feel free to send me a message!

Many of my projects are publically available on this GitHub - a few, including Mahjong 4 Friends, were removed once I implemented monetization. 

A few highlights:
- [ecc521/rivers.run](https://github.com/ecc521/rivers.run) - The first website & app I ever published, now used by paddlers and canoe clubs across the US.
- [ecc521/capacitor-zoom-android](https://github.com/ecc521/capacitor-zoom-android) - My first Capacitor plugin, now an npm package
- [capacitor-community/text-to-speech](https://github.com/capacitor-community/text-to-speech) & [capacitor-community/admob](https://github.com/capacitor-community/admob) - plugins I contriubte to and use in my apps.
- [ecc521/space-saver](https://github.com/ecc521/Space-Saver) - An electron (Windows, Mac, & Linux) app utilizing transparent filesystem compression to save disk space. Still useful, and not implemented by any of the major disk cleaning softwares yet, but 14 year old me never got the UI good enough to release. I may come back and publish it out eventually now that I have developer accounts and $99 is no longer a barrier. 

There's plenty more to see, I'll leave that for the readmes!

Happy coding! 

Tucker
